# NURA-Insights-Team-Project
Project on Predicting Credit worthiness of Small Business

## I. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

In pursuit of evaluating the creditworthiness of small businesses across diverse metrics, this project aims to provide valuable insights for financial decision-making. Understanding the factors that contribute to the financial health and viability of small businesses is crucial for lenders, policymakers, and stakeholders alike. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset encompassing various attributes such as loan details, borrower information, and economic indicators, this analysis endeavors to identify patterns and predictors of creditworthiness. Such insights can inform lending practices, risk assessment strategies, and support initiatives aimed at fostering the growth and sustainability of small businesses.
### 1.2 Data Sources

The dataset utilized for this analysis comprises 94,673 observations and 35 columns, encompassing a wide array of data types including datetime, integer, float, and object. Key variables include loan details (such as approval date, loan duration, and disbursement date), borrower information (such as name, address, and business type), and financial metrics (such as gross approval amount, charge-off amount, and jobs supported). Access to the dataset can be found here.

## Conclusions 
Decision Tree Dominance: The decision tree model demonstrates strong performance with a balanced accuracy of 92.4% and robust precision, recall, and f1-score metrics, particularly for creditworthy businesses.

XGBoost Precision and Recall: XGBoost exhibits high precision and recall for both classes, achieving a balanced accuracy of 95%, making it reliable for identifying creditworthiness.

Consistent Performance: Despite model complexity differences, both decision tree and XGBoost consistently deliver high accuracy and reliability in assessing credit risk across small businesses.

Insightful Metrics Influence Lending: Analysis of diverse metrics informs lending practices, helping lenders refine risk assessment strategies and support initiatives for small business growth.

Financial Decision-Making Impact: Findings offer valuable insights for financial decision-makers, guiding loan approvals, risk management, and policy interventions to foster resilience and inclusivity in small business financing.
